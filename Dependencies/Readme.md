Dependencies  
These are baked into the repo, as at the current time of writing, the latest release of the Wooting SDK does not support the Wooting Two

`wooting-analog-sdk.dll` is from Gottz    
`wooting-rgb-sdk.dll` is from BigBrain  

Additionally, `Wooting.NET.dll` is baked into the repo, as the current version does not seem to support .NET Framework.  
[PR 3](https://github.com/simon-wh/Wooting.NET/pull/3) should hopefully fix this
